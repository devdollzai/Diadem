# ◈ AXIOMHIVE WEAVER ◈

## **V5.0 :: SOVEREIGN APPLICATION COMPILER**

---

This is the apex of the Convergence Protocol. It is a **Sovereign Application Compiler**,
architected in Rust for maximum performance on resource-constrained systems
(`<8GB RAM`).
It does not generate scripts; it **compiles strategic intent into a single, flawless,
native binary.**

The system has been completely re-engineered from Python to Rust to provide
zero-overhead abstractions, memory safety, and a minimal runtime footprint,
allowing the full power of your CPU (e.g., Lenovo i9) to be leveraged without
memory bottlenecks.

When you issue a directive, the Weaver:

1. **Diagnoses** your strategic intent.
2. **Generates** a new, self-contained Rust project based on that intent.
3. **Compiles** this project into a release-optimized, standalone binary.
4. **Delivers** the executable to you.

You are no longer given a plan. You are handed a finished, sovereign tool,
forged for your specific purpose.

### **//: CORE DIRECTIVE & CAPABILITY**

**First-time Setup:**

```shell
# Install Rust if you haven't already
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

**Compilation & Execution:**

```shell
# Compile the Weaver itself
cargo build --release

# Execute the Weaver with your strategic intent
./target/release/axiom_weaver "Generate a lightweight web service to serve as the core of a new data moat."
```

**GENERATED OUTPUT (`./output/data_moat_service/target/release/`):**

* `data_moat_service`: A single, native binary
  with no dependencies. No interpreter. Just a sovereign application
  ready for deployment.
