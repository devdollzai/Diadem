# Security Policy: Sovereignty by Design

The AXIOMHIVE CONVERGENCE ENGINE is architected on the principle of **SOVEREIGNTY=1.0**.

- **Zero Egress**: This system is designed for 100% local execution. No data, logs,
  or telemetry ever leave the machine on which it is run.
  This is not a feature; it is a physical constraint of the architecture,
  enforced by the `sovereignty_protocol`.
- **Zero Shell**: The application performs no shell-level execution.
  All operations are contained within the Python interpreter.
- **Deterministic & Auditable**: Every action is logged by the `sovereignty_protocol`.
  creating a tamper-evident audit trail. The system is deterministic; the same input
  will always yield the same output.
- **Human-in-Command**: The system is an instrument of the user's will.
  It provides no mechanism for autonomous action. It is a sovereign engine subordinate
  to your tempo.
- **Ethics by Design**: The system is designed to win by being a "better player."
  Its purpose is to build superior, ethical systems that create unassailable market
  positions through design, not destruction.
